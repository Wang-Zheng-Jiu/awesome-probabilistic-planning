## Software


### Online Tools

* [planning.domains](http://planning.domains/)
A collection of tools for working with planning domains. Tutorial available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPoWf-cKSww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPoWf-cKSww). Source code available at [https://bitbucket.org/planning-researchers/cloud-solver](https://bitbucket.org/planning-researchers/cloud-solver).

### Parsers

* [PDDL-pp](https://github.com/thiagopbueno/pddlparser-pp)

### Planners

#### Classical

* [Lightweight Automated Planning Toolkit](https://github.com/LAPKT-dev/LAPKT-public)
LAPKT stands for the **Lightweight Automated Planning ToolKiT**. It aims to make your life easier if your purpose is to create, use or extend basic to advanced Automated Planners. It's an open-source Toolkit written in C++ and Python with simple interfaces that give you complete flexibility by decoupling parsers from problem representations and algorithms.

#### Probabilistic

* [G-Pack](https://github.com/arian/G-pack-2.0)
G-pack is a software package for planning under uncertainty that currently implements: **LR^2TDP** (Reverse Iterative Deepening LRTDP), **Glutton**, the runner-up at the 2011 International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC-2011), essentially a beefed-up offline version of LR^2TDP; and **Gourmand**, an online version of Glutton. Because planning offline isn't feasible for large MDPs, Gourmand tends to outperform Glutton on such problems.

* [PROST](https://bitbucket.org/tkeller/prost/wiki/Home)
Keller, Thomas, and Patrick Eyerich. **PROST: Probabilistic Planning Based on UCT.** In ICAPS. 2012.

* [SPUDD](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/research/spudd/index.php)

### Simulators

* [RDDLSim](https://github.com/ssanner/rddlsim)
Implements a parser, simulator, and client/server evaluation architecture for the relational dynamic influence diagram language (RDDL) -- pronounced "riddle".

### Libraries

* [Colorado University Decision Diagrams (CUDD)](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/html/)
